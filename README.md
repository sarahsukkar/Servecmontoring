Python-Server-Monitor
Background
I wrote this Python script to monitor our synchronization servers to ensure they are always available, if not, send the production support team an email. It uses Win32 libraries to run a command in the Windows CMD and scan the resulting output for the attributes you specify.

I have also added boolean dictionaries for each check and parameter in case you want to further extend the script functionality.

Current checks
Currently, this script performs 4 types of checks:

Process check: checks if the process(es) specified are in RUNNING state
Port check: checks if the specified ports (specified 8000 and 8001 in the script) are in LISTENING state
Service check: checks if the specified substrings (for example, JBoss-8000 and Tomcat7-8001) are started
Database connectivity check: checks if the specified database (server, username, password and database name to be specified) are available by running a select query on some table.
Email server
Obtain the address of your SMTP mail server from your IT admin, use any custom email address for the 'from' field. Specify the recipients in the array in server.sendmail statement.

Best practices
There are sometimes timeouts, it is best if you hit the panic button for two consecutive missed heartbeats. Schedule the script to 5 minute intervals in Windows Task Scheduler and it will monitor your services as long as the script is running.
